        Ok! Now we're ready to start!
        <br>
        <br>
        We're going to play a little guessing game: you'll see some cartoon-like dialogues where one person asks another one a question.
        <br>
        <br>
        That person checks their phone and responds based on information they see there.
        <br>
        <br>
        You'll then be presented with two phone pictures. In one of them, you can see the details of the screen, while in the other one the phone is turned upside down.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your goal will be to guess which of the two phones is the one that the person is looking at, based on what this person is saying in the picture. As a general rule, you'll select the phone with the visible screen if you think that the information on the screen fits what is being said. You'll select the one turned upside down, instead, if you think that the information on the visible screen does <strong>not</strong> fit with what the person said.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that <strong>just one of the pictures</strong> goes with what the second person responds. So you should only choose the phone that’s turned upside down if you don’t think the person giving the answer would have said what they did if they had been looking at the visible phone screen.
